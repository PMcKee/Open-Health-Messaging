Endpoint Location Service v1.3
==============================

These WSDL and XML Schema files are for the version 1.3 release of the
Endpoint Location Service.

These files are a companion to the "Endpoint Location Service:
Technical Service Specification v1.3" document.

Additional files

For convenience, dependent XML Schema files from the specifications
that ELS depends upon are also included. These are the Qualified
Certificate Reference and Web Services Profiles XML Schema files.

Version 1.2.1:

   the Standards Australia specifications.
